# Kryptoteket-discord-cron
An Azure App Function for checking kryptotekets userbets

##
This is just a cron job that runs ever night at 23:55 PM, and checking for userbets created with the [bot](https://github.com/loekensgard/Kryptoteket-discord-bot).\
If a userbet is found the job will check some criterias and announce a bet-winner in a discord channel.
